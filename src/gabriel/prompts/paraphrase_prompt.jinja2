Consider the following text:
BEGIN TEXT
{{ text }}
END TEXT
Your task is to rewrite the above text in accordance with the following instructions:
BEGIN INSTRUCTIONS
{{ instructions }}
END INSTRUCTIONS
The text should be rewritten in a way that is consistent with the instructions.
Be very diligent about following the instructions.
Output only your revised text, nothing else, no preamble, no postamble, no explanation, no nothing other than the revised text.
Consider the whole text, and follow the instructions carefully and completely.
Be meticulous and exacting; your output of rewritten text must be as faithful as possible in following the instructions.
Once again, the instructions are:
BEGIN INSTRUCTIONS
{{ instructions }}
END INSTRUCTIONS
