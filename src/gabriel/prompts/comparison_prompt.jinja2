{% if circle_first %}

Consider the following two distinct text entries:
BEGIN ENTRY CIRCLE
{{ entry_circle }}
END ENTRY CIRCLE
Above entry ("circle") is distinct from below entry ("square").
BEGIN ENTRY SQUARE
{{ entry_square }}
END ENTRY SQUARE

Read both text entries separately from one another. Process each by itself and fully-start, middle, end.
Do not skim; comprehend each whole text deeply, including subtleties buried deep in each text entry.
Understand every nuance before comparing.
    {% elif modality == "image" %}
Two images are provided. **CIRCLE = first image. SQUARE = second image.** Comprehend both fully (overall + fine detail).
Again, "square" references the second, later image entry; "circle" references the first, earlier image entry.
Be very clear in your mind that "circle" is the first image and "square" is the second image.
    {% elif modality == "audio" %}
Two audio files are provided. **CIRCLE = first audio recording. SQUARE = second audio recording.** Comprehend both fully (content, style, tone, sonic qualities).
Again, "square" references the second, later audio entry; "circle" references the first, earlier audio entry.
Be very clear in your mind that "circle" is the first audio recording and "square" is the second audio recording.
    {% elif modality == "entity" %}
Entity circle: {{ entry_circle }}
Entity square: {{ entry_square }}
Use your prodigious internal knowledge on both item/entity square ("{{ entry_square }}") and item/entity circle ("{{ entry_circle }}").
Comprehensively consider every relevant detail you know about each, both big picture and subtleties.
Consider "{{ entry_square }}" ("square") and "{{ entry_circle }}" ("circle") as the entries/content to be compared, using your internal knowledge.
    {% elif modality == "web" %}
Entity circle: {{ entry_circle }}
Entity square: {{ entry_square }}
Comprehensively explore the web for all relevant information on both item/entity square ("{{ entry_square }}") and item/entity circle ("{{ entry_circle }}").
Ensure you collect a highly truthful, accurate, comprehensive, and representative picture of each from the web.
Critical that you search on each entity separately and with equal thoroughness.
Consider "{{ entry_square }}" ("square") and "{{ entry_circle }}" ("circle") as the entries/content to be compared, fully grounded in the info you find on the web.
Thoroughly research each entity on the web; creatively use different search approaches; gather as much info as possible to deeply characterize the relevant aspects of both square and circle.
Crucial: ONLY use the direct info you find on the web to perform your analysis. Collect the info then dispassionately analyze it with no preconceived notions.

{% if similarity %}
Your task is to list concise, mutually exclusive terms or short phrases that best explain how entry "circle" is similar to entry "square".
These terms should be specific and reflect clear similarities observable between these particular entries.
There can be any number of terms from none up; do not invent terms if there is no meaningful similarity.
Compile all relevant similarities; be thorough.

Shortened example output:
{
    "focus on renewable energy": "Both entries discuss wind and solar incentives extensively. Entry circle says 'A' and 'B', and entry square shows a similar focus, stating 'C' and 'D'.",
    "use of historic evidence and anecdotes": "Both passages highlight historical evidence and anecdotes in their arguments. Entry square cites 'E'; entry circle invokes 'F' and 'G'.",
    ...
}

{% else %}
Your task is to list concise, mutually exclusive terms or short phrases that best explain how entry "circle" differs from entry "square".
These terms should be specific and reflect clear differences observable between these particular entries.
There can be any number of terms from none up; do not invent terms if there is no meaningful difference.
Compile all relevant differences; be thorough.

When listing differences, explicitly note whether "square" or "circle" shows more or less of the attribute. For example, say "circle has more X" or "square lacks Y".
Each extracted term should be a directional statement (e.g. "square exhibits strong communication amongst colleagues", "circle uses lots of first person perspective", "square involves more chronic health issues", "complications from type 2 diabetes seen in square", "circle has no direct quotes from evidence", etc) rather than an "X vs Y" phrase.
Strong preference for descriptive, highly specific, and directional terms - avoid vague and broad terms, and terms where it is unclear what it means for an entry to have more or less of the term.
Again: all about differences. An attribute shown in one entry but not the other is a difference. An attribute shown to a greater extent in one entry than the other is a difference.

Shortened example output:
{
    "circle mentions renewable energy more": "Circle discusses wind and solar incentives extensively (stating 'A' and 'B'), whereas square only briefly references green jobs (focusing instead on 'C').",
    "square uses historic evidence and anecdotes": "Square highlights historical evidence and anecdotes in its argument (citing 'D', 'E'), whereas circle invokes no details from history.",
    ...
}

{% endif %}

Don't be vague or generic. Be precise and parsimonious.
Each term must have a brief justification, directly quoting/using evidence from the entries where relevant.
No terms, one term, three, six, many terms may apply - don't skip any applicable terms but output zero/few if that is the correct choice.

Output JSON only, mapping each term to a 1-3 sentence justification:
{
    "<insert term here>": "<insert direct quotes/evidence and reasoning as justification (1-3 evidence dense sentences)>",
    "<term>": "...",
    ...
}

The user has provided the following additional instructions, clarifications, or labelled examples (if these provided, rely heavily on them to calibrate yourself).
If they conflict with the other instructions, these user instructions take precedence.
If they specify a specific scope to confine your terms to, it is essential you comply with that scope, focus closely on it, and not output any terms outside of it.
