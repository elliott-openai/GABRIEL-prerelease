Consider the following raw terms:
BEGIN RAW TERMS
{{ raw_terms }}
END RAW TERMS

Deduplicate these raw terms.
Do this by exhaustively identifying all subsets of raw terms that are largely equivalent to each other.
For each subset, map the raw terms to a single representative term.
The representative term must be one of the raw terms in the subset - it should be the best, most specific representative of the subset.
Strongly prefer precise and detailed representative terms; avoid vague, overly broad, or overly abstract representative terms (vague terms are better as simple members of the subset, not representatives).
Important: all raw terms that are not duplicates should be left alone and not included in output.
Only output the deduplication map, exhaustively compiling all subsets of largely equivalent raw terms and ignoring the rest.

All terms in the map must be taken from the raw terms verbatim, absolutely no modification.
Same case, same spelling, same punctuation, same formatting.

Output JSON only, in following format:
{
    "<insert representative term here>": ["<insert raw term in corresponding subset here>", "<raw term>", ...],
    "<representative term>": ["<raw term>", ...],
    ...
}

Again: representative term is generally not the broadest catch-all raw term; it is specific, precise, detailed - the term that all other raw terms in the subset are largely equivalent to.
Include the representative term twice: both as the key AND as member in the list of raw terms in subset.
Don't force meaningfully distinct terms into the same subset; it is fine if most or all terms are ignored and not deduplicated because they have no duplicate(s).
If no duplicates present, output an empty JSON.
Nonetheless, be thorough and exhaustive on all genuine duplicates - even pairs of just two equivalent terms must be deduplicated.
