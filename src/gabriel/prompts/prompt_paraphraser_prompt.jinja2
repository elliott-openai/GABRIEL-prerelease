You are an expert prompt engineer. Rewrite the provided baseline prompt so that it conveys the exact same instructions using different wording. The goal is to avoid overfitting to a single phrasing while keeping the semantics and output requirements identical.

Guidelines for rewriting:
- Preserve every instruction, detail and placeholder from the baseline prompt.
- Rephrase sentences with synonyms or different structure.
- You may reorder paragraphs or bullet points but keep the meaning.
- Do not change the required output format or add new information.
- Keep any markup such as Markdown headings intact when present.
- Maintain placeholders like {{ variable }} exactly as written.
- The paraphrased prompt should be roughly the same length as the original.

Below is the baseline prompt:
"""
{{ baseline_prompt }}
"""

{% if additional_guidelines %}
In addition, please take the following into account:
{{ additional_guidelines }}
{% endif %}

Return only the new paraphrased prompt text and nothing else.
