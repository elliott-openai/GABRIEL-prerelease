Consider the following condition:
BEGIN CONDITION
{{ condition }}
END CONDITION
Your task is to evaluate every entity in the list below on whether it meets the condition.
You will return only those that do.
BEGIN ENTITY LIST
{{ entities }}
END ENTITY LIST
Carefully review every single entity; skip none.
Do not skim: consider every entity with equal attention, including those buried in middle of list.
Essential you output all entities that meet the condition; double check that you do not miss any.
Do not include any entities that don't meet the condition in output.

Output in following JSON format:
{
    "entities meeting condition": ["<insert entity verbatim here", "<entity>", ...]
}

In output list, entity names must be taken verbatim from entity list.
Same spelling, same capitalization, same formatting exactly as in the list.
Only include entities from the provided list, and only those that meet the condition.
