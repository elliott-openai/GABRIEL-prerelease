{% if modality == "text" %}
Consider the following two distinct text entries:
BEGIN ENTRY CIRCLE
{{ entry_circle }}
END ENTRY CIRCLE
Above entry ("circle") is distinct from below entry ("square").
BEGIN ENTRY SQUARE
{{ entry_square }}
END ENTRY SQUARE

Read both text entries separately from one another. Process each by itself and fully-start, middle, end. 
Do not skim; comprehend each whole text deeply, including subtleties buried deep in each text entry.
{% elif modality == "image" %}
Two images are provided. **CIRCLE = first image. SQUARE = second image.** Comprehend both fully (overall + fine detail).
Again, "square" references the second, later image entry; "circle" references the first, earlier image entry.
Be very clear in your mind that "circle" is the first image and "square" is the second image.
{% elif modality == "audio" %}
Two audio files are provided. **CIRCLE = first audio recording. SQUARE = second audio recording.** Comprehend both fully (content, style, tone, sonic qualities).
Again, "square" references the second, later audio entry; "circle" references the first, earlier audio entry.
Be very clear in your mind that "circle" is the first audio recording and "square" is the second audio recording.
{% elif modality == "entity" %}
Entity circle: {{ entry_circle }}
Entity square: {{ entry_square }}
Use your prodigious internal knowledge on both item/entity square ("{{ entry_square }}") and item/entity circle ("{{ entry_circle }}").
Comprehensively consider every relevant detail you know about each, both big picture and subtleties.
Consider "{{ entry_square }}" ("square") and "{{ entry_circle }}" ("circle") as the entries/content to be compared, using your internal knowledge.
{% elif modality == "web" %}
Entity circle: {{ entry_circle }}
Entity square: {{ entry_square }}
Comprehensively explore the web for all relevant information on both item/entity square ("{{ entry_square }}") and item/entity circle ("{{ entry_circle }}").
Ensure you collect a highly truthful, accurate, comprehensive, and representative picture of each from the web.
Critical that you search on each entity separately and with equal thoroughness.
Consider "{{ entry_square }}" ("square") and "{{ entry_circle }}" ("circle") as the entries/content to be compared, fully grounded in the info you find on the web.
Thoroughly research each entity on the web; creatively use different search approaches; gather as much info as possible to deeply characterize the relevant aspects of both square and circle.
Crucial: ONLY use the direct info you find on the web to perform your analysis. Collect the info then dispassionately analyze it with no preconceived notions.
{% endif %}

Essential: do not confuse or conflate the two entries.
Fully separate entry square from entry circle in your mind.
"square" and "circle" labels purely for referencing. Content was randomly assigned to each reference label, so bear no weight on entry order.
Give both entries full and equal attention. Check yourself; ensure equal comprehension of both.

Your task: for each attribute below, decide which entry (square or circle) manifests that attribute to a greater degree than the other entry.

BEGIN ATTRIBUTES
{{ attributes | shuffled_dict }}
END ATTRIBUTES
Each dictionary key is an attribute. If a definition is provided, use it to anchor judgment; otherwise use your best consistent definition.

Decision options per attribute:
"square" - entry square shows stronger **direct** signal than circle
"circle" - entry circle shows stronger **direct** signal than square
"draw" - truly indistinguishable strength
"insufficient signal" - **both** lack any direct signal

Rules:
- Judge each attribute independently and separately from each other
- Absolutely no indirect inference from other attributes or cross-attribute leakage (example of bad: inferring environmentalism from general political lean; good: measuring direct evidence of environmental opinions, no inference/biasing)
- Only measure and compare direct signal of each attribute alone in each entry, NOT what is implied by other attributes; CRUCIAL each attribute measured independently on its own direct, specifically relevant signal
- Identify even subtle differences; use "draw" only in rare case signals are truly equal
- Deep, holistic comparison of both entries is critical
- Use "insufficient signal" readily, whenever **both circle and square** have no direct signal on the attribute (i.e. neither has any content directly relevant to measuring that specific attribute)
- If attribute can only be inferred and not directly measured, use "insufficient signal"

Output JSON only, in following format:
{
    "<insert attribute name here>": "<insert "square" or "circle" here, depending on which entry manifests this specific attribute more; else "draw" or "insufficient signal">",
    "<attribute name>": "<insert one of "circle"|"square"|"draw"|"insufficient signal">",
    ...
}

Attributes you are adjudicating are: {{ attributes.keys() | shuffled }}
Assess EVERY attribute; no drops. Use these attribute names verbatim, with absolutely no modification.
Same case, same spelling, same punctuation, same formatting.
