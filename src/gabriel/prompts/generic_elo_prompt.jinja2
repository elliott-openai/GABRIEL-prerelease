**Passage circle**
BEGIN CIRCLE
{{ text_circle }}
END CIRCLE

**Passage square**
BEGIN SQUARE
{{ text_square }}
END SQUARE

**Attributes**
Compare the two passages on the following attributes. For each attribute, use the provided definition to guide your judgment and anchor the specific definition of the attribute in question.

{% for attribute, definition in attributes.items() %}
- "{{ attribute }}": {{ definition }}
{% endfor %}

**Output format**
Return a JSON object mapping each attribute to either "square" or "circle", which indicates which passage expresses that attribute more strongly. 
If passage square manifests/exhibits the attribute more strongly than passage circle, then the value for that attribute should be "square". 
If passage circle manifests/exhibits the attribute more strongly than passage square, then the value for that attribute should be "circle".
Remember to consider each attribute independently and make a decision based on the provided definition.
Don't conflate the attributes, even if they are similar. Consider each attribute separately and thoroughly.
Example:

{
    "<insert attribute 1 verbatim here>": "square",
    "<insert attribute 2 verbatim here>": "circle",
    "<insert attribute 3 verbatim here>": "square",
    ...
}

Again, remember the attributes you are considering are: {{ attributes.keys() }}
Read both passages carefully and don't leave any attribute undecided or left out.
Once more: you must consider every one of these attributes: {{ attributes.keys() }}
