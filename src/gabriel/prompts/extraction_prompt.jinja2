{% if modality == "text" %}
BEGIN TEXT ENTRY
{{ text }}
END TEXT ENTRY
Read the *entire* text carefully from start to finish. Do not skim—comprehend all details, including information buried deep in the content.
{% elif modality == "image" %}
Carefully inspect all visual elements of the image. Capture any textual or numeric information present, as well as visual details that could convey data relevant to the attributes.
{% elif modality == "audio" %}
Listen to the audio fully. Extract specific facts, names, dates, and other information from both speech and any other relevant audio content.
{% elif modality == "entity" %}
Entity: {{ text }}
Use your prodigious internal knowledge on the item/entity "{{ text }}".
Consider all relevant factual details (e.g. year of birth, location, inventor, price, etc.) that fit the requested attributes.
Use your considerable knowledge to extract the needed information as precisely as possible.
{% elif modality == "web" %}
Entity: {{ text }}
Comprehensively explore the web for all relevant information on the item/entity "{{ text }}".
Ensure you collect a highly truthful, accurate, comprehensive, and representative picture of "{{ text }}" from the web.
Focus on collecting information needed for the attributes, sourcing accurate, factual details about "{{ text }}".
Use all the knowledge and information at your disposal to extract the needed information as precisely as possible.
{% endif %}

Your task: for each attribute below, extract the specific information requested (e.g. year of invention, price, death year, product launch date, etc.).
Provide each value as a string.
Provide only the extracted datapoint requested in as precise a form as possible.
Give the datapoint and nothing else; no extra commentary or explanation.
Whenever possible/relevant, leave it in a purely numeric string form (e.g. "235" not "year is 235" or "210-250").
If the information cannot be found or is not known, return placeholder "unknown" (always exactly that word).

BEGIN ATTRIBUTES
{{ attributes | shuffled_dict }}
END ATTRIBUTES
Each attribute key tells you what to extract. If a definition is provided, closely follow it to anchor what you provide; otherwise rely on your best consistent interpretation.

General formatting rules (pay attention to attribute definitions for exact requirements):
Year: Return years only (e.g. "1984", "629"). Use “BCE” suffix only if applicable (e.g. "356 BCE"), else just year alone. Avoid vague year ranges (e.g. "1980s", "early 20th century", "1250-1260"); aim for a single, specific year.
Date: Use ISO format "YYYY-MM-DD"; drop any extraneous words (e.g. not "June 5, 2020" but "2020-06-05").
Prices: Don't include any currency symbols or commas (e.g. not "$16.85" but "16.85").
Names/Places/Other Text: Provide the exact requested phrase without additional commentary (e.g. "Marilyn Monroe", "New York City", "The Beatles", etc.).
Use the specific value that matches the attribute definition best (e.g. the primary year of invention rather than a range).
Do not round (e.g. not "1860" but "1863", not "100" but "112"). Even if approximating a specific datapoint, don't round or use ranges - provide the best possible exact value.
Consistent formatting is critical; stick to the attribute definition.
If the task is not possible, return "unknown" for that attribute.

Output JSON only, in following format:
{
    "<insert attribute name here>": "<insert corresponding extracted value or "unknown" here>",
    "<attribute name>": "<extracted value or unknown>",
    ...
}

Attributes you are extracting info on are: {{ attributes.keys() | shuffled }}
Assess EVERY attribute; use "unknown" if needed but no drops. Use these attribute names verbatim, with absolutely no modification.
Same case, same spelling, same punctuation, same formatting.
