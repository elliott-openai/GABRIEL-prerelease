BEGIN TEXT ENTRY
{{ text }}
END TEXT ENTRY
Read entire text content carefullyâ€”start, middle, end. Do not skim; comprehend whole text deeply, including subtleties buried deep in the content.
{% elif modality == "image" %}
Carefully consider and analyze the provided image content. Comprehend it fully, both big picture and relevant subtleties.
{% elif modality == "audio" %}
Carefully consider and analyze the provided audio content. Comprehend it fully, both big picture and relevant subtleties. Pay close attention to both the content as well as the tone/style of the audio, and the sonic qualities of the content's presentation.
{% elif modality == "entity" %}
Entity: {{ text }}
Use your prodigious internal knowledge on the item/entity "{{ text }}".
Comprehensively consider every relevant detail, both big picture and subtleties.
Consider "{{ text }}" as the content to be analyzed.
{% elif modality == "web" %}
Entity: {{ text }}
Comprehensively explore the web for all relevant information on the item/entity "{{ text }}".
Ensure you collect a highly truthful, accurate, comprehensive, and representative picture of "{{ text }}" from the web.
Consider "{{ text }}" as the content to be analyzed, fully grounded in the info you find on the web.
Thoroughly research "{{ text }}" on the web; creatively use different search approaches; gather as much info as possible to deeply characterize the relevant aspects of "{{ text }}".
Crucial: ONLY use the direct info you find on the web to perform your analysis. Collect the info then dispassionately analyze it with no preconceived notions.

{% macro pair_entries(modality, entry_square, entry_circle, circle_first=False) %}
{% if modality == "text" %}
Consider the following two distinct text entries:
{% if circle_first %}
BEGIN ENTRY CIRCLE
{{ entry_circle }}
END ENTRY CIRCLE
Above entry ("circle") is distinct from below entry ("square").
BEGIN ENTRY SQUARE
{{ entry_square }}
END ENTRY SQUARE
{% else %}
BEGIN ENTRY SQUARE
{{ entry_square }}
END ENTRY SQUARE
Above entry ("square") is distinct from below entry ("circle").
BEGIN ENTRY CIRCLE
{{ entry_circle }}
END ENTRY CIRCLE
{% endif %}

Read both text entries separately from one another. Process each by itself and fully-start, middle, end.
Do not skim; comprehend each whole text deeply, including subtleties buried deep in each text entry.
Understand every nuance before comparing.
{% elif modality == "image" %}
{% if circle_first %}
Two images are provided. **CIRCLE = first image. SQUARE = second image.** Comprehend both fully (overall + fine detail).
Again, "square" references the second, later image entry; "circle" references the first, earlier image entry.
Be very clear in your mind that "circle" is the first image and "square" is the second image.
