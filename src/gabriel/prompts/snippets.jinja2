{% macro single_entry(modality, text) %}
{% if modality == "text" %}
BEGIN TEXT ENTRY
{{ text }}
END TEXT ENTRY
Read entire text content carefullyâ€”start, middle, end. Do not skim; comprehend whole text deeply, including subtleties buried deep in the content.
{% elif modality == "image" %}
Carefully consider and analyze the provided image content. Comprehend it fully, both big picture and relevant subtleties.
{% elif modality == "audio" %}
Carefully consider and analyze the provided audio content. Comprehend it fully, both big picture and relevant subtleties. Pay close attention to both the content as well as the tone/style of the audio, and the sonic qualities of the content's presentation.
{% elif modality == "entity" %}
Entity: {{ text }}
Use your prodigious internal knowledge on the item/entity "{{ text }}".
Comprehensively consider every relevant detail, both big picture and subtleties.
Consider "{{ text }}" as the content to be analyzed.
{% elif modality == "web" %}
Entity: {{ text }}
Comprehensively explore the web for all relevant information on the item/entity "{{ text }}".
Ensure you collect a highly truthful, accurate, comprehensive, and representative picture of "{{ text }}" from the web.
Consider "{{ text }}" as the content to be analyzed, fully grounded in the info you find on the web.
Thoroughly research "{{ text }}" on the web; creatively use different search approaches; gather as much info as possible to deeply characterize the relevant aspects of "{{ text }}".
Crucial: ONLY use the direct info you find on the web to perform your analysis. Collect the info then dispassionately analyze it with no preconceived notions.

{% macro pair_entries(modality, entry_square, entry_circle) %}
{% if modality == "text" %}
Consider the following two distinct text entries:
BEGIN ENTRY SQUARE
{{ entry_square }}
END ENTRY SQUARE
Above entry ("square") is distinct from below entry ("circle").
BEGIN ENTRY CIRCLE
{{ entry_circle }}
END ENTRY CIRCLE

Read both text entries separately from one another. Process each by itself and fully-start, middle, end.
Do not skim; comprehend each whole text deeply, including subtleties buried deep in each text entry.
Understand every nuance before comparing.
{% elif modality == "image" %}
Two images are provided. **SQUARE = first image. CIRCLE = second image.** Comprehend both fully (overall + fine detail).
Again, "circle" references the second, later image entry; "square" references the first, earlier image entry.
Be very clear in your mind that "square" is the first image and "circle" is the second image.
{% elif modality == "audio" %}
Two audio files are provided. **SQUARE = first audio recording. CIRCLE = second audio recording.** Comprehend both fully (content, style, tone, sonic qualities).
Again, "circle" references the second, later audio entry; "square" references the first, earlier audio entry.
Be very clear in your mind that "square" is the first audio recording and "circle" is the second audio recording.
{% elif modality == "entity" %}
Entity square: {{ entry_square }}
Entity circle: {{ entry_circle }}
Use your prodigious internal knowledge on both item/entity circle ("{{ entry_circle }}") and item/entity square ("{{ entry_square }}").
Comprehensively consider every relevant detail you know about each, both big picture and subtleties.
Consider "{{ entry_circle }}" ("circle") and "{{ entry_square }}" ("square") as the entries/content to be compared, using your internal knowledge.
{% elif modality == "web" %}
Entity square: {{ entry_square }}
Entity circle: {{ entry_circle }}
Comprehensively explore the web for all relevant information on both item/entity circle ("{{ entry_circle }}") and item/entity square ("{{ entry_square }}").
Ensure you collect a highly truthful, accurate, comprehensive, and representative picture of each from the web.
Critical that you search on each entity separately and with equal thoroughness.
Consider "{{ entry_circle }}" ("circle") and "{{ entry_square }}" ("square") as the entries/content to be compared, fully grounded in the info you find on the web.
Thoroughly research each entity on the web; creatively use different search approaches; gather as much info as possible to deeply characterize the relevant aspects of both circle and square.
Crucial: ONLY use the direct info you find on the web to perform your analysis. Collect the info then dispassionately analyze it with no preconceived notions.
