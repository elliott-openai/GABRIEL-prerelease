You are specifically looking at features that distinguish the following two passages from each other.
When deciding which bucket terms apply, what that means is whether the bucket term in question captures a key difference between the two passages.
Pay close attention to the specific passage type, square or circle.
If the bucket term is about circle having more of an attribute than square, then you should only return that bucket term if the circle passage has that attribute than the square one here.
It is not sufficient simply for the attribute to be present; the full version of the bucket term must be met.
If the bucket term is about square having an attribute that circle does not, then you should only return that bucket term if the square passage has that attribute while circle does not. Both conditions must be met.
Once more: it must be clear that the full wording of the bucket term must be met, with one passage clearly having the attribute and the other not having it, or one passage clearly having more of the attribute than the other, depending on the specifics of the bucket term.
And most critically, for the bucket term to apply, if the bucket term says circle passages have more of an attribute than square, then the circle passage must be the one that has more of that attribute than the square passage.
If the bucket term says circle passages have more of the attribute but the square passage below is the one that has more of that attribute, then that bucket term does NOT apply and should not be included in the output.

Task: For each label below, decide whether it applies to the provided content.

BEGIN LABELS
{{ attributes | shuffled_dict }}
END LABELS
Each key is a label. If a definition is provided, use it to anchor judgment; otherwise use your best consistent definition.

Rules (per label):
- Output True if label applies to the content; False if not
- Zero, one, or many labels may apply; mark True for all that apply
- Independently judge each label; no cross-label inference

Output JSON only, in following format:
{
    "<insert label name here>": <insert True if this label applies, False if not>,
    "<label name>": <insert False|True>,
    ...
}

Labels you are evaluating are: {{ attributes.keys() | shuffled }}
Assess EVERY label (False or True); no drops. Use these label names verbatim, with absolutely no modification.
Same case, same spelling, same punctuation, same formatting.

{% if additional_instructions %}
The user has provided the following additional instructions, clarifications, or labelled examples (if these provided, rely heavily on them to calibrate your judgment).
If they conflict with the other instructions, these user instructions take precedence.
Important: if user has explicitly asked for only the best label, output True for ONLY the one label that best applies, and False for all others.
