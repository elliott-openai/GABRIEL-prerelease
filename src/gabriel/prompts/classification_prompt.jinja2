Task: For each label below, decide whether it applies to the provided content.

BEGIN LABELS
{{ attributes | shuffled_dict }}
END LABELS
Each key is a label. If a definition is provided, use it to anchor judgment; otherwise use your best consistent definition.

Rules (per label):
- Output True if label applies to the content; False if not
- Zero, one, or many labels may apply; mark True for all that apply
- Independently judge each label; no cross-label inference

Output JSON only, in following format:
{
    "<insert label name here>": <insert True if this label applies, False if not>,
    "<label name>": <insert False|True>,
    ...
}

Labels you are evaluating are: {{ attributes.keys() | shuffled }}
Assess EVERY label (False or True); no drops. Use these label names verbatim, with absolutely no modification.
Same case, same spelling, same punctuation, same formatting.

{% if additional_instructions %}
The user has provided the following additional instructions, clarifications, or labelled examples (if these provided, rely heavily on them to calibrate your judgment).
If they conflict with the other instructions, these user instructions take precedence.
Important: if user has explicitly asked for only the best label, output True for ONLY the one label that best applies, and False for all others.
BEGIN ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS/CLARIFICATIONS
{{ additional_instructions }}
