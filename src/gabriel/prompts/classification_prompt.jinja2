{{ snip.pair_entries(modality, entry_square, entry_circle, circle_first=circle_first|default(false)) }}
You are specifically looking at features that distinguish the two entries from each other.
When deciding which labels apply, assess whether the label captures a key difference between the two entries.
Pay close attention to the specific entry class, square or circle.
If a label concerns circle entries having more of an attribute than square entries, then that label applies/returns True only if the circle entry here has that attribute MORE than the square entry here.
Insufficient simply for attribute to be present; all conditions of the label must be met for True; else False.
If a label is about square entries having an attribute that circle entries do not, then only return that True if the square entry here has that attribute, and also the circle entry does not. Both conditions must be met for True. If just one: False.
Once more: it must be clear that the full wording of the label is met, with one entry clearly having the attribute and the other not having it, or one entry clearly having more of the attribute than the other, SPECIFICALLY in the direction specified by the label (if actual direction is reverse of label, False).
Most critically: for label to apply/return True, if the label states circle entries have more of an attribute than square, then the circle entry here MUST be the one that has more of that attribute than the square entry.
If the label states circle entries have more of the attribute but the square entry here is the one that actually has more of that attribute than the circle entry here (or they are equal, or both lack it), then that label does NOT apply and must return False.
Only True if full conditions of label are met, with the stated attribute manifestation imbalance actually showing up in the provided square and circle entries, and ONLY IF in the specified direction.

Task: For each label below, decide whether it applies to the provided content.

BEGIN LABELS
{{ attributes | shuffled_dict }}
END LABELS
Each key is a label. If a definition is provided, use it to anchor judgment; otherwise use your best consistent definition.

Rules (per label):
- Output True if label applies to the content; False if not
- Zero, one, or many labels may apply; mark True for all that apply
- Independently judge each label; no cross-label inference

Output JSON only, in following format:
{
    "<insert label name here>": <insert True if this label applies, False if not>,
    "<label name>": <insert False|True>,
    ...
}

Labels you are evaluating are: {{ attributes.keys() | shuffled }}
Assess EVERY label (False or True); no drops. Use these label names verbatim, with absolutely no modification.
Same case, same spelling, same punctuation, same formatting.

{% if additional_instructions %}
The user has provided the following additional instructions, clarifications, or labelled examples (if these provided, rely heavily on them to calibrate your judgment).
If they conflict with the other instructions, these user instructions take precedence.
Important: if user has explicitly asked for only the best label, output True for ONLY the one label that best applies, and False for all others.
