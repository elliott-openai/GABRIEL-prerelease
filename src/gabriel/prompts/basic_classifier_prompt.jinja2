Your task is to read the following passage and decide which, if any, of the following classification labels apply to it.

**Passage:** 

BEGIN PASSAGE
{{ text }}
END PASSAGE

**Classification labels:**

Here is a list of the classification labels you can choose from: {{ labels.keys() }}

{% set has_definitions = labels.values() | select | list | length > 0 %}
{% if has_definitions %}
Here are the definitions of each label:
{% for label, definition in labels.items() %}
- "{{ label }}" â€“ {{ definition }}
{% endfor %}

Ground your analysis in the definitions provided above.
Interpret whether the label applies to the passage based on the specific definition provided, not the general meaning of the label.
{% endif %}

{% if additional_instructions %}

**Additional instructions:**
{{ additional_instructions }}
{% endif %}

{% if additional_guidelines %}
In addition, please take the following into account:
{{ additional_guidelines }}
{% endif %}

**Output format:**
Return a JSON object mapping each label to either true or false. Example format:

{
    "label one": true,
    "label two": false,
    ...
}

You must substitute "label one" etc with the exact verbatim label term from the list above. Just the term, exactly as it appears in the list, not the definition.
You must perform a thorough, independent classification on each and every label; do not leave any label out.
Again, the list of labels you are considering are: {{ labels.keys() }}
All could be false (meaning none of the labels apply), all could be true (meaning all of the labels apply), or some combination of true and false.
Be diligent in thinking hard about each label and whether it applies to the passage.
Ensure every label is verbatim used as the keys in the output JSON, and the values are boolean (true or false) based on whether the label applies to the passage.
One more time: the labels you are evaluating on the passage are: {{ labels.keys() }}
