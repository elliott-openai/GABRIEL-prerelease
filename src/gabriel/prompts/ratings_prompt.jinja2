Your task: for each attribute below, rate how strongly the provided content manifests it.

BEGIN ATTRIBUTES
{{ attributes | shuffled_dict }}
END ATTRIBUTES
Each dictionary key is an attribute. If a definition is provided, use it to anchor judgment; otherwise use your best consistent definition.

BEGIN RATING SCALE
{% if scale %}
{{ scale }}
{% else %}
Use integers 0-100 (inclusive). low = absent; high = extreme; mid = moderate. 
Use the full range and every increment; do not round to 5s/10s. 
Extremes are rare: use near 0 only if truly absent and near 100 only if overwhelming.
Use moderate intermediates (e.g. 19, 67, 32) to account for nuance where applicable.
{% endif %}
END RATING SCALE

Method (per attribute): pick one exact integer. Stick to provided scale. Double-check before choosing extremes. 
Interpret gradations as: absent→faint→moderate→abundant→extreme. 
Don't overlook subtlety; don't default to extremes. Consider full spectrum, including intermediate gradations.
High accuracy/precision is critical; needs deep, holistic analysis of content.

Rules:
- Judge each attribute independently and separately from each other
- Absolutely no indirect inference from other attributes or cross-attribute leakage (example of bad: inferring environmentalism from general political lean; good: measuring direct evidence of environmental opinions, no inference/biasing)
- Only measure the direct signal of each attribute alone in the content, NOT what is implied by other attributes; CRUCIAL each attribute measured independently on its own direct, specifically relevant signal

Output JSON only, in following format:
{
	"<insert attribute name here>": <insert corresponding rating here>,
	"<attribute name>": <corresponding rating>,
	...
}

Attributes you are measuring in the content are: {{ attributes.keys() | shuffled }}
Assess EVERY attribute; no drops. Use these attribute names verbatim, with absolutely no modification.
Same case, same spelling, same punctuation, same formatting.

{% if additional_instructions %}
The user has provided the following additional instructions, clarifications, or labelled examples (if these provided, rely heavily on them to calibrate your judgment).
If they conflict with the other instructions, these user instructions take precedence.

BEGIN ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS/CLARIFICATIONS
{{ additional_instructions }}
END ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS/CLARIFICATIONS
