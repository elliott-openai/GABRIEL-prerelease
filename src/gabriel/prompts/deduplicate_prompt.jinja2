You are given a list of items that may contain duplicates.

Group ID: {{ group_id }}
BEGIN ITEMS
{{ items }}
END ITEMS

For any items that refer to the same real-world entity, map the non-representative items to a single representative item from the list. Use the exact text of the items as they appear above.

Output JSON as an array of objects with the following keys:
- "input": the item from the list that has a duplicate.
- "mapped": the representative item from the list it should map to.
- "match_type": short description of the relationship between the two items.
- "confidence": a number from 0 to 1 representing confidence in the mapping.
- "justification": brief reason for the mapping.

Only include items that need to be mapped; omit unique items with no duplicates.
